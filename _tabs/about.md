I'm a **software developer** based in Cape Town, South Africa.

I've been trying to be a good leader since 2017, coding professionally since 2011, amateur :P since 2003. Domains I've worked in professionally include finance, insurance, investment, trading and MERL tech (social impact). **C# and Flutter is nice**, but so are many other things.

Agile and Scrum has become an emerging passion for me over the years. Enough to do an A-CSD and do some **Agile and process coaching** on the side.

I have too many hobbies, but I really like being outdoors and doing obstacle course races. I buy too many books, which forces me to read them. Sometimes I write things, but I don't always publish it, tomorrow I'll do more.

If you like doing good in the world or are **interested in Social Impact and ESG**, reach out, I always enjoy hearing about how technology and people make the world and lives better, I might even collaborate if I have time.
