As humans, we learn to communicate through through interaction in the physical world. Taking and giving social and physical cues are baked into our DNA - tone of voice, micro-expressions, body language, eye contact and bio-mimicry. Working remotely denies us natural access to most of these and lower quality versions of others. By working remotely, you and your team are possibly losing touch with the human side of communicating.

## How do these impact us?
If you don't *intentionally* adapt for the lack of natural social cues, you put yourself at a  disadvantage. 

Research has shown that remote work can impede communication and collaboration. In your own space it might be difficult because naturally, communication and collaboration isn't a mathematical skill - so attributing directly problems to remote work can be challenging. I work in the software development industry, and from my own experience in organizations and team interactions, there were trends that have correlated to the increase in remote work (or full remote)

- Quiet individuals disappearing in the crowd in your team and withdrawing
- Increased mental health concerns
- Individuals struggling to getting a point across
- Low verbal participation in meetings
- Clear lack of focus in meetings (individuals and group)
- Lack of shared mental models in understanding after meetings
- Meeting objectives not met

## Redefining communicating like a human in a virtual
Suddenly relearning to communicate - and this is essentially what transitioning to remote results in - doesn't happen overnight. Bad habits form quickly and if you and your team are going to thrive in a digital workspace, you have to put in conscious effort. One way to improve communication is to mitigate the loss of social cues while in a virtual space. Do this by consciously by reinforcing physical domain cues and supplementing them with new techniques and tools.

This isn't a comprehensive list, but a personal shortlist of what has been effective in our domain and others'. Notice that many of them apply in the physical work environment too - communication and collaboration has always required work:

- Encourage web cams of particpants being on - this gives you back *some* body language cues, some facial expressions and some form of eye contact
- Supplement social and physical cues - use features like raising your hand and showing emotions/emoticons to show engagement and stay in the conversation. With low latency and small teams, this can be handled with cameras being on, but often people start speaking over each other that can cause frustration and disengagement
- Make use of verbal cues - replace the lack of body language with increased verbal cues such as confirmations to replace nods. Nothing is worse to an individual than speaking to silent darkness -(imagine being blind and talking to a crowd)
- Stay focused: with the ability to hide distractions or the temptation to multi-task or type in chat *while* in a meeting, its easier to be distracted or to distract the speaker in virtual meetings. As a particpant, avoid doing this and focus on the speaker and meeting/collaboration objective.

There are many other techniques that overlap with good facilitation, active listening skills and general conversational and collaboration skills that can improve the way we communicate, but there is a theme in the above - being empathetic towards the speaker and other team members and focusing on active participation.

When it comes to meeting success, be deliberate:
- Use online tools fully: learn to use your tools properly (Miro, Microsoft Whiteboard etc.). Being a power user on digital whiteboards and drawing tools helps immensely with efficient collaboration and participation
- Meeting objectives - this counts in in person meetings too, but set an agenda and an objective. Create a shared mental model and objective to work towards.
- Grow your facilitation skills - learn to facilitate better - another no-brainer, but take a digital (or normal) facilitation course. Being able to facilitate collaboration is a superpower to achieving goals together

These have another clear theme - you need to adapt and improve your ability to communicate effectively and being mindful of how you do that virtually

## Conclusion
As online tools improve and with the global increase during and post COVID-19 fully or partially remote teams are here to stay. The point is that it is important that we consider the fact that hosting, facilitating, and participating in a virtual environment *removes a lot of the communication tools we naturally have as humans* and we need to be conscious about mitigating and adapting the way we communicate while part of a team that does not have physical proximity.
