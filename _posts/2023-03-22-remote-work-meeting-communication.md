As humans we learn to interact in person. Social and physical cues are baked into our DNA - microexpressions, body language, eye contact and bio-mimicry. Working remotely denies us natural access to all of these and you and your team are possibly losing out.

## Am I still communicating like a human
If you don't *intentionally* adapt for the lack of natural social cues, you put yourself at a  disadvantage. 

If you are you seeing any of these symptions working remotely, you might have forgotten how to

- Struggling with getting a point across
- Low participation in meetings
- Quiet individuals disappearing in the crowd in your team and withdrawing
- Drifting / lack of focus in meetings or finding yourself wondering *'what person X doing, are they still in the meeting?'*

## Re-learning to communicate like a human
The objective is to mitigate the loss of cues while online. Do this by replacing in-person techniques and supplement with new techniques, but be wary of some anti-patterns

- Do keep and encourage camera's - get back body language and the perception of eye contact
- Do use online tools fully - use feature like raising your hand and showing emotions/emoticons to show engagement and stay in the conversation. With low latency and small teams, this can be handled with cameras being on, but often people start speaking over each other and slow down communication and cause frustration and disengagement
- Do use verbal cues - keep using like you would in person, but also replace the lack of body language with increased verbal cues. Nothing is worse to a speaker than speaking to the darkness - imagine being blind and talking to a crowd.
